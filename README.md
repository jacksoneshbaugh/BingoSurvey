# BingoSurvey
## A new unique way to conduct surveys or even create games!

### What is BingoSurvey?
Bingo Survey is a webapp that allows for the formatting of a survey as a bingo board. This allows for a more interactive and fun way to conduct surveys. Administrators can create boards, and users can fill them out. The results are then stored in a database and can be exported to a CSV file.

### How to use BingoSurvey
Clone and deploy the repository.

### Features
- Surveys as bingo boards!
- Results can be exported to a CSV file.
- Multiple boards can be active at once.
- User accountsâ€”you must be registered to play.

### What is the story behind BingoSurvey?
BingoSurvey originated from a request from a friend I (Jackson E.) know from Lafayette College, asking me if I knew of any websites that allowed for a progressive game to be played with a bingo board style survey component. He was planning a game about networking and wanted to have a week-long game where people could fill out a survey in the form of a bingo board. Since I couldn't find any websites that did this (and I was on spring break), I decided to make one myself.

### What is the future of BingoSurvey?
Here's a short (hopefully up-to-date) list of features that I'd love to implement in the future:
- [ ] Question Types
  - Currently, the only question type is a text input. It would be nice to have multiple question types, such as multiple choice, checkboxes, etc.
- [ ] More robust export functionality
  - Currently, the export functionality is very basic. It would be nice to have a more robust export functionality, such as the ability to export only certain columns, or to export only certain rows, or even to export multiple surveys into one file. Also, the ability to export to other file types, such as plaintext or Excel excites me.
- [ ] More robust user accounts
  - Currently, the only thing you can do with a user account is to play a board. It would be nice to have more robust user accounts, such as the ability to create boards, or to view past results.
You can see the full list of features I'd like to implement in the TODO.md file.
